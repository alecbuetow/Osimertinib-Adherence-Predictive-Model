# Humana Case Competition - Designing a Model to Predict Patient Drug Adherence and Providing a Plan to Address Non-Adherence

Predictive analytics were performed via a neural network in order to identify patients at risk of prematurely ending their Osimertinib treatment. An AUC of 0.93 was achieved on validation data through focused feature selection. This project was undertaken as part of the Humana-Mays Healthcare Analytics Case Competition, where our team proceeded to the semifinals, placing in the top 50 of 150 teams.

# Overview

Osimertinib is a targeted therapy designed to \emph{restrain} uncontrolled cell growth (as opposed to eliminating cancerous cells) and is primarily used for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It serves as a maintenance medication prescribed to patients post-surgery, with the aim of reducing cancer recurrence.
